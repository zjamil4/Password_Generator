CS 1026 - Assignment 2 â€“ Password Strength

******************************

This file controls the interaction between users and creating a password. It asks the user to either use the password generator or create their own password. 
The program will loop continuously until the user inputs a password that is more than or equal to the minimum strength. If the user enters "X" or "x," a 15-character 
random password is created. The strength of every password entered is checked out, and if the password satisfies the strength requirement, the associated feedback is shown. 
If it is strong enough, the software exits; if not, it requests a new input.
