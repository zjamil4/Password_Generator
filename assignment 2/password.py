CS 1026 - Assignment 2 â€“ Password Strength

******************************

This file has two primary functions for determining the strength of a password and examining what it contains.
How many of the four specified character groups from lowercase, uppercase, digits, and symbols are included in a password
that is determined by the first function. Using the helper, the second function checks the password's overall strength
by looking at its length and the range of character groups it contains. The password is automatically assigned the lowest
strength score if it contains invalid characters such as spaces, tabs, or newlines.
